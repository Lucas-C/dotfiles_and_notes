Quicksort: stable, constant space usage, worst case O(n^2) if pivot is smallest/largest element, not good if data on disk
Merge sort : stable, O(n) space on arrays / constant space on linked lists, worst case O(n*log(n)), ok if data on disk
TimSort: used by Python, mix of merge sort & insertion sort, perform well on real-word data
IntroSort: C++ std::sort, a variation over QuickSort which "degenerates" to HeapSort when the recursion goes too deep
Radix / Counting sort: the best for ints
-> cf. include/linux/radix-tree.h / lib/radix-tree.c from the linux kernel (detailed in "linux-insides")
-> Algorithmic complexity attack, e.g. McIlroy sort killer, which build an input to make any sorting quadratic in time
Pdqsort: the best unstable sort so far -> https://github.com/orlp/pdqsort

To get a better locality of reference (= elements accessed in sequence are located in memory addresses close to each other),
binary search trees are better implemented using a contiguous array following a red-black tree's breadth-first order (like a heap basically)

Trie / directed acyclic graph can be + efficient than binary search trees / hash tables
HAMT: "achieves almost hash table-like speed while using memory much more economically. Also, a hash table may have to be periodically resized, an expensive operation, whereas HAMTs grow dynamically" -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie

New CVM algorithm - Counting Distinct Elements in Streams (liked by D. Knuth): https://chezsoi.org/shaarli/shaare/V8UsIQ
    -> implementation uses `treap` ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap ) that maintain a dynamic set of ordered keys and allow binary searches among the key

Succint data structures: use an amount of space that is "close" to the information-theoretic lower bound but still allow for efficient query operations, by encoding data very efficiently in-place, so that it does not need to be decompressed to be used.

- Google Zopfli (5% more compression, 100x slower than LZMA (7z))
- Google Brotli: better than zlib, LZMA (7z) and Snappy/Zopfli in term of speed AND compression ratio
- Facebook Zstd: very fast lossless data compression algorithm, comparable to lzma, lzham, ppmx, lza or bzip2; use LZ4 & xxHash libs

## Crypto

encrypting a file with its hash as the key, aka convergent encryption :
https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/40kq5x/what_are_the_ramifications_of_encrypting_a_file/
Benefit: you can easily check the file integrity
Benefit 2: if no random prefix/suffix is added (=> weaker security), it can be used as unique identifier for deduping
